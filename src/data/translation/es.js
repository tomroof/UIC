<h4>What is Healthy Starts?</h4>
<p>Healthy Starts an innovative new interactive learning experience for kids, and their parents,  to learn why taking care of their teeth is so important, how to do it well, and share their accomplishments with friends. We think of this as sort of like fitbit for dental care.</p>
<h4>How do I gets started?</h4>
<p>First, choose your age group, coach and dental team. Then, you can choose a topic or play the one assigned by your dentist. As you play, your progress is tracked and you will earn points and badges! Check out your profile page to see your progress. The games can be played on a desktop computer, or any mobile device of your choice. Some of the games are best played while you’re brushing your teeth in the bathroom, so we recommend using a smartphone or tablet.</p>
<p>After playing, review your progress with parents and your dentist to learn how you might do better and earn more points.</p>
